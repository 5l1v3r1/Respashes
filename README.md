# Respashes
Grabs login hashes in &lt;1 sec

• Author: kuyaya

• Firmware support: All firmwares

• Target: Windows/Mac/Linux

## Description
The payload uses responder to grab the login hashes. It works when the PC is locked.

Payload running time: ~ 10 seconds (9 sec booting up, 1 sec is the acutal payload).

Not a single AV has detected something yet.

## Configuration
You need to download responder from the [Hak5 Forums](https://forums.hak5.org/topic/40971-info-tools/).

Be sure to temporarily disable the AV so it doesn't get removed during download and installation.

Then just copy-paste the payload.txt into one of the switch folders. (Doesn't matter if switch1 or switch2)

If you have an idea on how to improve the payload or if you have an issue (e.g. the payload itself is not working) don't hesitate to PM me by E-Mail or at the [Hak5 Forums](https://forums.hak5.org/profile/63440-kuyaya/).
